# Command system

### Command System (`renderer/src/lib/commands/`)

The composer parses input into typed `ComposerAction` discriminated unions:
- `!text` → bash command
- `/command [args]` → slash command (builtins mirror pi's TUI: model, compact, name, session, new, export, fork, clone, resume, copy, quit, settings, diff, tree, login, reload)
- Otherwise → user prompt

Builtins are defined in `builtins.ts` (mirrors pi's interactive-mode.js). Discovered commands (extensions/prompts/skills) come from `get_commands` RPC. `parse.ts` resolves input to an action; `execute.ts` dispatches it. Submitters tag host-bound prompts with their invocation surface (`composer` for the React Composer, `unified` for the unified-TUI editor), so extension custom UI opens where the command was triggered instead of always reusing an existing unified TUI. Unknown slash passthrough is conservative: if a slash-shaped prompt reaches execution without a discovered command source (for example because the command list was stale), Pi-Vis sends it to pi but does not add an optimistic user bubble, set optimistic streaming, or convert it to `steer`; pi's subsequent events decide whether real agent work began. This prevents extension commands that only open custom/selector UI from looking like a submitted text prompt.

**`/login`** dispatches `{ kind: "open-login" }` → the composer fires a `pivis:open-login` CustomEvent → `App.tsx` opens Settings scrolled to the Account section.

**`/scoped-models`** opens the `ScopedModelsPicker` (a multi-select checkbox list mirroring pi's TUI `showModelsSelector`). Two submit actions match pi's TUI: **Apply** (`set_scoped_models`, session-only — lost on `/reload` since a fresh process rebuilds from `settingsManager.getEnabledModels()`), and **Save to settings** (`save_scoped_models`, global — persists to pi's `settings.json` via `settingsManager.setEnabledModels` AND applies to the current session immediately). After either action the renderer re-fetches `get_available_models` (the bridge returns the scoped subset when `scopedModels` is non-empty) so the `/model` dropdown reflects the new scope live. Footer also has **Select all** / **Select none** bulk toggles.

### Prompt preflight and steer routing

Prompt submits now track local submit liveness with `promptsInFlight` instead of faking streaming. Submit routing uses logical `isWorking` (`isStreaming || promptsInFlight > 0`), so a second submit while a prompt IPC is still in flight routes as `steer`. Unknown slash passthrough remains excluded from both optimistic prompt liveness and steer conversion.

Failed prompt or steer sends throw `InputNotConsumedError`; the Composer restores the submitted text/attachments and skips post-success draft clearing. Steers show only queued bubbles until pi delivers the authoritative user message.
